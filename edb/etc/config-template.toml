## exceeds `brane-compact-tombstones-percent`.
# brane-compact-tombstones-percent = 30

## Interval to check whether to spacelike a manual compaction for Dagger PrimaryCauset Network.

[lmdb]
## Maximum number of threads of Lmdb background jobs.
## The background tasks include compaction and flush. For detailed information why Lmdb needs to
## do compaction, see Lmdb-related materials. Lmdb will adjust flush and compaction threads
## according to the formula:
##   max_flushes = max_flushes = max(1, max_background_jobs / 4)
##   max_compactions = max(1, max_background_jobs - max_flushes)
## When write traffic (like the importing data size)  is big, it is recommlightlikeed to enable more
## threads. But set the number of the enabled threads  smaller than that of CPU cores. For example,
## when importing data, for a machine with a 32-core CPU, set the value to 28.
## The default value is set to 8 or CPU_NUM - 1, whichever is smaller.
# max-background-jobs = 8

## Represents the maximum number of threads that will concurrently perform a sub-compaction job by
## breaking it into multiple, smaller ones running simultaneously.
## The default value is set to 3 or the largest number to allow for two compactions, whichever is
## smaller.
# max-sub-compactions = 3

## Number of open files that can be used by the DB.
## Value -1 means files opened are always kept open and Lmdb will prefetch index and filter
## blocks into block cache at spacelikeup. So if your database has a large working set, it will take
## several minutes to open the DB. You may need to increase this if your database has a large
## working set. You can estimate the number of files based on `target-file-size-base` and
## `target_file_size_multiplier` for level-based compaction.
# max-open-files = 40960

## Max size of Lmdb's MANIFEST file.
## For detailed explanation, please refer to https://github.com/facebook/lmdb/wiki/MANIFEST
# max-manifest-file-size = "128MB"

## If the value is `true`, the database will be created if it is missing.
# create-if-missing = true

## Lmdb Write-Ahead Logs (WAL) recovery mode.
## 0 : TolerateCorruptedTailRecords, tolerate incomplete record in trailing data on all logs;
## 1 : AbsoluteConsistency, We don't expect to find any corruption in the WAL;
## 2 : PointInTimeRecovery, Recover to point-in-time consistency;
## 3 : SkipAnyCorruptedRecords, Recovery after a disaster;
# wal-recovery-mode = 2

## Lmdb WAL directory.
## This config specifies the absolute directory path for WAL.
## If it is not set, the log files will be in the same directory as data. When you set the path to
## Lmdb directory in memory like in `/dev/shm`, you may want to set`wal-dir` to a directory on a
## persistent causet_storage. See https://github.com/facebook/lmdb/wiki/How-to-persist-in-memory-Lmdb-database .
## If there are two disks on the machine, storing Lmdb data and WAL logs on different disks can
## improve performance.
# wal-dir = "/tmp/edb/store"

## The following two fields affect how archived WAL will be deleted.
## 1. If both values are set to 0, logs will be deleted ASAP and will not get into the archive.
## 2. If `wal-ttl-seconds` is 0 and `wal-size-limit` is not 0, WAL files will be checked every 10
##    min and if total size is greater than `wal-size-limit`, they will be deleted spacelikeing with the
##    earliest until `wal-size-limit` is met. All empty files will be deleted.
## 3. If `wal-ttl-seconds` is not 0 and `wal-size-limit` is 0, then WAL files will be checked every
##    `wal-ttl-seconds / 2` and those that are older than `wal-ttl-seconds` will be deleted.
## 4. If both are not 0, WAL files will be checked every 10 min and both checks will be performed
##    with ttl being first.
## When you set the path to Lmdb directory in memory like in `/dev/shm`, you may want to set
## `wal-ttl-seconds` to a value greater than 0 (like 86400) and backup your DB on a regular basis.

## Use O_DIRECT for both reads and writes in background flush and compactions.
# use-direct-io-for-flush-and-compaction = false

## Limit the disk IO of compaction and flush.
## Compaction and flush can cause terrible spikes if they exceed a certain memory_barrier. Consider
## setting this to 50% ~ 80% of the disk throughput for a more sBlock result. However, in heavy
## write workload, limiting compaction and flush speed can cause write stalls too.
## 1. rate-bytes-per-sec is the only parameter you want to set most of the time. It controls the
##    total write rate of compaction and flush in bytes per second. Currently, Lmdb does not
##    enforce rate limit for anything other than flush and compaction, e.g. write to WAL.
## 2. rate-limiter-refill-period controls how often IO tokens are refilled. Smaller value will flatten
##    IO bursts while introducing more CPU overhead.
## 3. rate-limiter-mode indicates which types of operations count against the limit.
##    1 : ReadOnly
##    2 : WriteOnly
##    3 : AllIo
## 4. auto_tuned enables dynamic adjustment of rate limit within the cone
##    [rate_bytes_per_sec / 20, rate_bytes_per_sec], according to the recent demand for background I/O.
# rate-bytes-per-sec = 0

## Compression method (if any) is used to compress a block.
##   no:     kNoCompression
##   snappy: kSnappyCompression
##   zlib:   kZlibCompression
##   bzip2:  kBZip2Compression
##   lz4:    kLZ4Compression
##   lz4hc:  kLZ4HCCompression
##   zstd:   kZSTD
## `lz4` is a compression algorithm with moderate speed and compression ratio. The compression
## ratio of `zlib` is high. It is frilightlikely to the causet_storage space, but its compression speed is
## slow. This compression occupies many CPU resources.

## Per level compression.
## This config should be chosen carefully according to CPU and I/O resources. For example, if you
## use the compression mode of "no:no:lz4:lz4:lz4:zstd:zstd" and find much I/O pressure of the
## system (run the `iostat` command to find %util lasts 100%, or run the `top` command to find many
## iowaits) when writing (importing) a lot of data while the CPU resources are adequate, you can
## compress level-0 and level-1 and exchange CPU resources for I/O resources. If you use the
## compression mode of "no:no:lz4:lz4:lz4:zstd:zstd" and you find the I/O pressure of the system is
## not big when writing a lot of data, but CPU resources are inadequate. Then run the `top` command
## and choose the `-H` option. If you find a lot of bg threads (namely the compression thread of
## Lmdb) are running, you can exchange I/O resources for CPU resources and change the compression
## mode to "no:no:no:lz4:lz4:zstd:zstd". In a word, it aims at making full use of the existing
## resources of the system and improving EinsteinDB performance in terms of the current resources.
# compression-per-level = ["no", "no", "lz4", "lz4", "lz4", "zstd", "zstd"]

## The data block size. Lmdb compresses data based on the unit of block.
## Similar to page in other databases, block is the smallest unit cached in block-cache. Note that
## the block size specified here corresponds to uncompressed data.
# block-size = "64KB"

## If you're doing point lookups you definitely want to turn bloom filters on. We use bloom filters
## to avoid unnecessary disk reads. Default bits_per_key is 10, which yields ~1% false positive
## rate. Larger `bloom-filter-bits-per-key` values will reduce false positive rate, but increase
## memory usage and space amplification.
# bloom-filter-bits-per-key = 10

## `false` means one SST file one bloom filter, `true` means every block has a corresponding bloom
## filter.
# block-based-bloom-filter = false

# level0-file-num-compaction-trigger = 4

## Soft limit on number of level-0 files.
## When the number of SST files of level-0 reaches the limit of `level0-slowdown-writes-trigger`,
## Lmdb tries to slow down the write operation, because too many SST files of level-0 can cause
## higher read pressure of Lmdb.
# level0-slowdown-writes-trigger = 20

## Maximum number of level-0 files.
## When the number of SST files of level-0 reaches the limit of `level0-stop-writes-trigger`,
## Lmdb stalls the new write operation.
# level0-stop-writes-trigger = 36

## Amount of data to build up in memory (backed by an unsorted log on disk) before converting to a
## sorted on-disk file. It is the Lmdb MemBlock size.
# write-buffer-size = "128MB"

## The maximum number of the MemBlocks. The data written into Lmdb is first recorded in the WAL
## log, and then inserted into MemBlocks. When the MemBlock reaches the size limit of
## `write-buffer-size`, it turns into read only and generates a new MemBlock receiving new write
## operations. The flush threads of Lmdb will flush the read only MemBlock to the disks to become
## an SST file of level0. `max-background-flushes` controls the maximum number of flush threads.
## When the flush threads are busy, resulting in the number of the MemBlocks waiting to be flushed
## to the disks reaching the limit of `max-write-buffer-number`, Lmdb stalls the new operation.
## "Stall" is a flow control mechanism of Lmdb. When importing data, you can set the
## `max-write-buffer-number` value higher, like 10.
# max-write-buffer-number = 5

## The minimum number of write buffers that will be merged together before writing to causet_storage.
# min-write-buffer-number-to-merge = 1

## Control maximum total data size for base level (level 1).
## When the level-1 data size reaches the limit value of `max-bytes-for-level-base`, the SST files
## of level-1 and their overlap SST files of level-2 will be compacted. The golden rule: the first
## reference principle of setting `max-bytes-for-level-base` is guaranteeing that the
## `max-bytes-for-level-base` value is roughly equal to the data volume of level-0. Thus
## unnecessary compaction is reduced. For example, if the compression mode is
## "no:no:lz4:lz4:lz4:lz4:lz4", the `max-bytes-for-level-base` value can be `write-buffer-size * 4`,
## because there is no compression of level-0 and level-1 and the trigger condition of compaction
## for level-0 is that the number of the SST files reaches 4 (the default value). When both level-0
## and level-1 adopt compaction, it is necessary to analyze Lmdb logs to know the size of an SST
## file compressed from a MemBlock. For example, if the file size is 32MB, the proposed value of
## `max-bytes-for-level-base` is 32MB * 4 = 128MB.

## Target file size for compaction.

## Specifies master key if encryption is enabled. There are three types of master key:
##
##   * "plaintext":
##
##     Plaintext as master key means no master key is given and only applicable when
##     encryption is not enabled, i.e. data-encryption-method = "plaintext". This type doesn't
##     have sub-config items. Example:
##     
##     [security.encryption.master-key]
##     type = "plaintext"
##
##   * "kms":
##
##     Use a KMS service to supply master key. Currently only AWS KMS is supported. This type of
##     master key is recommlightlikeed for production use. Example:
##
##     [security.encryption.master-key]
##     type = "kms"
##     ## KMS CMK key id. Must be a valid KMS CMK where the EinsteinDB process has access to.

##     ## desired.
##     lightlikepoint = "https://kms.us-west-2.amazonaws.com"
##
##   * "file":
##
##     Supply a custom encryption key stored in a file. It is recommlightlikeed NOT to use in production,
##     as it breaks the purpose of encryption at rest, unless the file is stored in tempfs.
##     The file must contain a 256-bits (32 bytes, regardless of key length implied by 
##     data-encryption-method) key encoded as hex string and lightlike with newline ("\n"). Example:
##
##     [security.encryption.master-key]
##     type = "file"
##     path = "/path/to/master/key/file"
##
# [security.encryption.master-key]
# type = "plaintext"

## Specifies the old master key when rotating master key. Same config format as master-key.
## The key is only access once during EinsteinDB spacelikeup, after that EinsteinDB do not need access to the key.
## And it is okay to leave the stale previous-master-key config after master key rotation.
